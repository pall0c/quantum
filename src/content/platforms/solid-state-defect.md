<trapping-title>Trapping Technique</trapping-title>

1. <trapping-notes>Point defects naturally embedded in crystal lattice during growth or implantation</trapping-notes>

1. <trapping-notes>Defects are fixed in crystal structure; no external trapping needed</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Can operate at room temperature due to weak coupling to phonons</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Individual defects can be addressed using focused laser or microwave fields</trapping-notes>
