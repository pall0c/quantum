<trapping-title>Trapping Technique</trapping-title>

1. <trapping-notes>Ions are trapped using radiofrequency (RF) and DC electric fields in Paul or Penning traps</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Paul trap uses oscillating RF field to create a pseudopotential that traps ions</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Penning trap uses static magnetic field combined with DC electric field</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Ions are laser-cooled to near ground state of motion</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Multiple ions can be trapped in linear or 2D arrays with precise spacing</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Ion chains form a crystal structure due to Coulomb repulsion</trapping-notes>

<gate-title>Gate Mechanism</gate-title>

1. <gate-notes>Single-qubit gates performed via laser or microwave pulses addressing individual ions</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Laser pulses drive optical or hyperfine transitions between qubit states</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Microwave pulses used for hyperfine qubits, avoiding photon scattering</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Two-qubit gates use shared motional modes (phonons) as a quantum bus</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Mølmer-Sørensen gate uses bichromatic laser fields to couple qubits via motion</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Direct Coulomb interaction can also mediate gates between nearby ions</gate-notes>
