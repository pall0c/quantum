<trapping-title>Trapping Technique</trapping-title>

1. <trapping-notes>Qubits are fabricated as superconducting circuits on a chip substrate</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Josephson junctions and capacitors create the qubit energy levels</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>No physical trapping required; confinement is through circuit design</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Qubits are fixed in position on the chip surface</trapping-notes>
1. <trapping-notes>Cooled to millikelvin temperatures to maintain superconductivity</trapping-notes>

<gate-title>Gate Mechanism</gate-title>

1. <gate-notes>Single-qubit gates performed via microwave pulses applied through control lines</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Microwave frequency matches qubit transition frequency for resonant driving</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Pulse duration and phase control rotation angle and axis</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Two-qubit gates use capacitive or inductive coupling between neighboring qubits</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>Coupling strength controlled by circuit geometry and applied DC voltages</gate-notes>
1. <gate-notes>CZ or iSWAP gates implemented via controlled phase accumulation or state swapping</gate-notes>
