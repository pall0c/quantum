title: Higgs Boson
---

The Higgs boson is an elementary particle and the quantum excitation of the Higgs field, a scalar field that permeates all of space. The Higgs field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, which breaks the electroweak symmetry and gives mass to elementary particles through the Higgs mechanism.
