title: Supersymmetry
---

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical symmetry that relates fermions and bosons, proposing that for every known fermion there exists a corresponding bosonic superpartner, and vice versa. It is one of the most promising extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, offering solutions to several theoretical problems including the hierarchy problem and dark matter.

<fermion-boson-title>Key Concepts</fermion-boson-title>

1. <fermion-boson-notes>Relates particles with different spin statistics: fermions ↔ bosons</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Each Standard Model particle has a superpartner with spin differing by 1/2</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Superpartners of fermions are called "sfermions" (e.g., selectron, squark)</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Superpartners of bosons are called "inos" (e.g., photino, gluino, higgsino)</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>If exact, supersymmetry would require superpartners to have the same mass as their Standard Model counterparts</fermion-boson-notes>

<fermion-boson-title>Standard Model vs SUSY Names</fermion-boson-title>

1. <fermion-boson-notes>Fermions → Sfermions (bosonic superpartners): electron → selectron, quark → squark, neutrino → sneutrino</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Gauge Bosons → Gauginos (fermionic superpartners): photon → photino, gluon → gluino, W boson → wino, Z boson → zino</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Higgs Boson → Higgsinos (fermionic superpartners): Higgs → higgsino</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Naming pattern: fermions get "s-" prefix (sfermions), bosons get "-ino" suffix (gauginos, higgsinos)</fermion-boson-notes>
1. <fermion-boson-notes>Examples: electron (e⁻) → selectron (ẽ), up quark (u) → sup quark (ũ), photon (γ) → photino (γ̃)</fermion-boson-notes>
