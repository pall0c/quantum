Discovery

1. Blackbody radiation: Otto Lummer; Ernst Pringsheim (1890s–1900)
   - Experimental spectrum contradicted classical physics; motivated Planck's energy quantization

1. Photoelectric effect: Philipp Lenard; Albert Einstein (1902–1905)
   - Electron emission depends on frequency, not intensity; evidence for light quanta

1. Atomic emission spectra: Johann Balmer; Johannes Rydberg (1885–1890s)
   - Discrete spectral lines implied quantized atomic energy levels

1. Franck–Hertz experiment: James Franck; Gustav Hertz (1914)
   - Direct experimental confirmation of discrete atomic energy states

Wave–particle duality confirmed

1. Compton scattering: Arthur Compton (1923)
   - Photon momentum and wavelength shift confirmed particle nature of light

1. Electron diffraction: Clinton Davisson; Lester Germer; G. P. Thomson (1927)
   - Matter-wave interference verified de Broglie's hypothesis

---

Foundations of quantum mechanics tested

1. Stern–Gerlach experiment: Otto Stern; Walther Gerlach (1922)
   - Spatial quantization and intrinsic spin revealed; classical angular momentum ruled out

1. Single-particle interference: Jönsson; Tonomura et al. (1960s–1980s)
   - Individual particles form interference patterns; wavefunction describes probabilities, not ensembles

---

Quantum electrodynamics & precision tests

1. Lamb shift: Willis Lamb; Robert Retherford (1947)
   - Small hydrogen energy shifts required QED corrections and renormalization

1. Anomalous magnetic moment of the electron: Multiple authors (1947–present)
   - Agreement between theory and experiment to parts per trillion; benchmark of QED accuracy

---

Entanglement and nonlocality

1. Bell inequalities: John Bell (1964)
   - Provided experimentally testable distinction between quantum mechanics and local hidden-variable theories

1. Bell test experiments: Alain Aspect et al. (1982)
   - Violation of Bell inequalities confirmed quantum nonlocal correlations

---

Many-body & condensed matter breakthroughs

1. Integer quantum Hall effect: Klaus von Klitzing (1980)
   - Exact quantization revealed topological invariants in quantum systems

1. Fractional quantum Hall effect: Tsui; Stormer; Laughlin (1982–1983)
   - Emergence of quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics

Modern quantum experiments

1. Bose–Einstein condensation: Eric Cornell; Carl Wieman; Wolfgang Ketterle (1995)
   - Macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state directly observed

1. Quantum teleportation: Dik Bouwmeester et al. (1997)
   - Quantum state transfer enabled by entanglement and classical communication

1. Loophole-free Bell tests: Ronald Hanson; Bas Hensen et al. (2015)
   - Closure of detection and locality loopholes; definitive nonlocality tests

1. Quantum computational advantage: Google Quantum AI (2019)
   - Task-specific demonstration of quantum speedup over classical computation

Quantum gravity–adjacent observations

1. Hawking radiation: Stephen Hawking (1974, theoretical)
   - Quantum particle production predicted in curved spacetime; no direct astrophysical detection yet
